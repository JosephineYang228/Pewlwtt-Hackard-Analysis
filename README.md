## Summary
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- Since there are 72458 employees going to retiring, I believe the number of roles need to be filled should at least keep the same.

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
- No, I think not quite enough.
